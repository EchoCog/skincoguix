# SKZ Integration Framework for OpenCog Cognitive Agents

This directory contains the implementation of the SKZ (Skin Zone Journal) autonomous agents framework integrated with the OpenCog/Guix cognitive ecosystem.

## Overview

The SKZ integration provides 7 autonomous agents that operate as OpenCog cognitive agents:

1. **Research Discovery Agent** - INCI database mining, patent analysis, trend identification
2. **Submission Assistant Agent** - Quality assessment, safety compliance, statistical review  
3. **Editorial Orchestration Agent** - Workflow coordination, decision making, conflict resolution
4. **Review Coordination Agent** - Reviewer matching, workload management, quality monitoring
5. **Content Quality Agent** - Scientific validation, safety assessment, standards enforcement
6. **Publishing Production Agent** - Content formatting, visual generation, multi-channel distribution
7. **Analytics & Monitoring Agent** - Performance analytics, trend forecasting, strategic insights

## Architecture

Each agent is implemented as an OpenCog cognitive agent using:
- **AtomSpace**: For knowledge representation and storage
- **Cognitive Grammar**: For pattern matching and reasoning
- **Distributed Network**: For inter-agent communication
- **Hypergraph Schema**: For tensor-based processing

## Usage

```bash
# Start the SKZ autonomous agents framework
./start-skz-agents.sh

# Test individual agents
guile skz-research-discovery-agent.scm --test
guile skz-submission-assistant-agent.scm --test
# ... etc for other agents

# Run integrated workflow
./test-skz-integration.sh
```

## Integration Points

- **AtomSpace Bridges**: Located in `bridges/` directory
- **Cognitive Grammar**: Integrated with existing `cognitive-grammar-integration-agent.scm`
- **Network Coordination**: Uses `distributed-network-coordinator.scm`
- **API Gateway**: Connects to KoboldCpp and other services

### Key Features Implemented

- **OpenCog AtomSpace Integration**: All agents store and retrieve knowledge using AtomSpace-compatible data structures
- **Cognitive Grammar Processing**: Agents integrate with existing cognitive grammar network for pattern recognition
- **Distributed Network Coordination**: Agents register and communicate through the distributed network coordinator
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Each agent implements autonomous reasoning and decision-making capabilities
- **Hypergraph Knowledge Representation**: Research data, assessments, and workflows stored as hypergraph nodes and links
- **Real-time Communication**: Agent-to-agent message passing for workflow coordination
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with integration validation

### Agent Capabilities

Each implemented agent provides:
- ✅ **Autonomous Processing**: Independent operation with cognitive decision-making
- ✅ **AtomSpace Integration**: Knowledge storage and retrieval using OpenCog data structures
- ✅ **Network Communication**: Registration and message handling with other cognitive agents
- ✅ **Hypergraph Representation**: Tensor-based knowledge encoding for cognitive processing
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging
- ✅ **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suites for validation
