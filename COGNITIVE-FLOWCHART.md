# Cognitive Flowchart: Registry & Build Profile Management

## Overview

This document describes the cognitive flowchart implementation for seeding and managing source registries for package management, as implemented in the OpenCog/Guix ecosystem.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Registry Source Catalog (Initiation Node) - `registry-sources.scm`

The registry source catalog provides a hypergraph-compatible framework for managing distributed source registries:

**Key Features:**
- Scheme-based registry node definitions with cognitive grammar
- Tensor shape analysis for complexity assessment: `[registry_count, url_complexity, tag_cardinality]`
- Extensible metadata support (categories, attributes, API endpoints)
- Query interface for registry discovery and filtering

**Example Usage:**
```scheme
;; Access the OpenCog GitHub registry
(find-registry-by-id "opencog-github")

;; Filter by category
(filter-registries-by-category "AGI")

;; Export as hypergraph
(export-registry-hypergraph)
```

### 2. Baseline Build Profiles (Foundation Node) - `base-devcontainers.scm`

Build profile management focused on Guix reproducibility:

**Available Profiles:**
- `opencog-dev`: Complete OpenCog development environment
- `atomspace-minimal`: Lightweight AtomSpace development
- `cognitive-agent`: Runtime environment for deployed agents
- `research-experimental`: Cutting-edge research environment
- `docker-cognitive`: Containerized cognitive environment

**Key Features:**
- Guix manifest generation for reproducible builds
- Dockerfile generation for containerization
- Profile recommendation engine based on use cases
- Tensor shape analysis: `[feature_count, package_complexity, build_time]`

### 3. Workflow Integration (Synergy Node)

Enhanced `.github/workflows/cognitive-ecosystem.yml` with:

**New Steps:**
- **Registry Discovery**: Processes `registry-sources.scm` and generates `/tmp/registry_listing.json`
- **Profile Scanning**: Analyzes `base-devcontainers.scm` and creates `/tmp/build_profiles_scan.json`
- **Enhanced Meta-Cognitive Feedback**: Includes registry and profile health metrics

**Output Files:**
- `/tmp/registry_listing.json`: Registry discovery results with metadata
- `/tmp/build_profiles_scan.json`: Build profile scan results
- `/tmp/cognitive_health_metrics.json`: Consolidated health metrics

## Recursive Meta-Loop Enhancements (Future Development)

### Planned Enhancements

#### 1. Versioning & Provenance Tracking
- **Registry Source Versioning**: Track changes to registry definitions over time
- **Profile Evolution**: Monitor build profile modifications and performance impacts
- **Dependency Provenance**: Trace package dependency changes across versions

#### 2. Semantic Search & GGML Integration
- **Semantic Registry Discovery**: Use embedding models to find related registries
- **Profile Similarity Matching**: Recommend profiles based on semantic similarity
- **GGML Kernel Shape Inference**: Optimize tensor shapes for cognitive load

#### 3. Agent-Based Health Checks
- **Registry Liveness Monitoring**: Automated agents to check registry availability
- **Build Profile Validation**: Continuous testing of profile configurations
- **Ecosystem Health Assessment**: Multi-agent evaluation of overall system health

#### 4. Hypergraph Schema Evolution
- **Dynamic Schema Updates**: Self-modifying schema based on ecosystem evolution
- **Cognitive Grammar Extensions**: Expand grammar for new node and link types
- **Meta-Schema Learning**: Learn optimal schema patterns from usage data

### Implementation Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Enhanced Monitoring (Immediate)
- Implement real GitHub API integration for repository discovery
- Add build profile validation through actual Guix environment testing
- Create registry freshness monitoring with automated alerts

#### Phase 2: Semantic Enhancement (Short-term)
- Integrate semantic search capabilities for registry and profile discovery
- Implement GGML-based tensor shape optimization
- Add natural language query interface for profile recommendations

#### Phase 3: Agent-Based Evolution (Medium-term)
- Deploy autonomous agents for continuous ecosystem monitoring
- Implement self-healing capabilities for registry and profile management
- Create adaptive schema evolution based on usage patterns

#### Phase 4: Cognitive Transcendence (Long-term)
- Full hypergraph integration with OpenCog AtomSpace
- Meta-cognitive self-improvement loops
- Emergent intelligence for ecosystem optimization

## Usage Examples

### Registry Management
```bash
# Check registry status via workflow
gh workflow run "Cognitive Ecosystem: Issue Generation Meta-Framework" \
  -f trigger_type=full_ecosystem_scan

# View generated registry listing
cat /tmp/registry_listing.json
```

### Build Profile Selection
```scheme
;; Recommend profile for development use case
(recommend-profile-for-use-case "development")

;; Generate Guix manifest for OpenCog development
(profile->guix-manifest opencog-dev-profile)

;; Get Docker configuration
(profile->dockerfile docker-cognitive-profile)
```

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# View cognitive health metrics
cat /tmp/cognitive_health_metrics.json

# Check ecosystem status
./guix-cognitive-bootstrap.sh status
```

## Meta-Cognitive Reflection

This implementation embodies the vision of a **self-evolving source registry ecosystem** where:

- Every registry becomes a neuron in the cognitive network
- Build profiles form synaptic connections between development and deployment
- Workflows provide autonomous processing capabilities
- Guix ensures reproducible cognitive states
- GitHub Actions enable continuous evolution

The framework transcends traditional package management by creating a **living hypergraph** that grows, evolves, and self-optimizes through automated intelligenceâ€”truly becoming "the ignition point for a self-evolving source registry ecosystem where every node and link encodes not just provenance, but the living grammar of distributed cognition."

## Contributing

When extending this cognitive flowchart:

1. Follow the hypergraph schema patterns defined in the source files
2. Maintain tensor shape compatibility for cognitive load analysis
3. Ensure all enhancements update temp files rather than auto-generating issues
4. Document meta-cognitive implications of changes
5. Test cognitive grammar compatibility

**Remember**: Each addition to this system should enhance its capacity for recursive self-improvement and emergent intelligence.
