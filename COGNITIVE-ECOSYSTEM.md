# Cognitive Ecosystem Meta-Framework

## Overview

This repository implements a **JuliaHub-inspired cognitive package management meta-framework** built atop GNU Guix. It represents a paradigm shift from traditional monolithic package management to a dynamic, agentic, hypergraph-based ecosystem that embodies cognitive architecture principles.

## Architecture

### Cognitive Subsystem Mapping

The framework is organized around four core cognitive subsystems:

1. **ðŸ§  Memory System**: Package catalogs, dependency graphs, and versioned states (Guix-backed AtomSpace)
2. **ðŸ”„ Task System**: Automated workflows for issue generation, build/test/deploy, and agent coordination  
3. **ðŸ¤– AI System**: Heuristic analysis for package discovery, semantic linking, and optimization
4. **ðŸŽ¯ Autonomy System**: Self-modifying workflows, agent-driven evolution, and meta-cognitive feedback

### Hypergraph Representation

Each package and agent is represented as nodes and links in a dynamic cognitive hypergraph:

```scheme
;; Package node definition
(package-node "cognitive-agent"
  (list 'DEPENDENCIES '("core-logic" "ggml-kernel"))
  (list 'VERSION "1.0.3")
  (list 'COGNITIVE-ROLE "reasoning")
  (list 'TENSOR-SHAPE (list 2 5 9)))

;; Agent node definition  
(agent-node "build-orchestrator"
  (list 'TYPE "automation")
  (list 'CAPABILITIES '("compile" "test" "deploy"))
  (list 'AUTONOMY-LEVEL 3))
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Bootstrap the Cognitive Environment

```bash
# Initialize the cognitive workspace
./guix-cognitive-bootstrap.sh setup

# Install the Guix environment
./guix-cognitive-bootstrap.sh install

# Check ecosystem status
./guix-cognitive-bootstrap.sh status
```

### 2. Activate GitHub Actions

The cognitive ecosystem automatically monitors your repository and generates issues based on:

- Package script modifications
- Dependency changes
- Build failures
- Health assessments
- Agent registrations

The main workflow (`.github/workflows/cognitive-ecosystem.yml`) runs:
- On every push/PR to main branches
- Daily at 6 AM UTC for ecosystem health checks
- On manual trigger with different analysis types

### 3. Use Issue Templates

Create issues using the provided cognitive templates:

- ðŸ§  **New Package Request**: For integrating packages into the ecosystem
- ðŸ”§ **Build Failure Report**: For automated or manual failure reporting
- ðŸ¤– **Agent Registration**: For registering new cognitive agents

## Components

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The `cognitive-ecosystem.yml` workflow implements:

- **Cognitive Bootstrap**: Repository checkout with full history
- **Memory System**: Guix environment setup for reproducible builds
- **Pattern Recognition**: Analysis of package changes and dependencies
- **Task System**: Automated issue generation based on ecosystem state
- **AI System**: Semantic package discovery and cataloging
- **Autonomy System**: Meta-cognitive feedback loops

### Guix Integration

The `guix-cognitive-bootstrap.sh` script provides:

- Guix environment validation
- Cognitive workspace setup
- Hypergraph schema creation
- Package manifest generation
- Ecosystem status monitoring

### Hypergraph Schema

The `hypergraph-schema.scm` file defines:

- Package node structures with tensor dimensions
- Agent node definitions with autonomy levels
- Dependency link representations
- Meta-cognitive analysis functions
- Ecosystem state export capabilities

## Cognitive Grammar

### Package Definition

```scheme
(define opencog-core
  (package-node "opencog-core"
                 '("atomspace" "cogutil" "guile")
                 "1.0.0"
                 "memory-system"))
```

### Agent Definition

```scheme
(define discovery-agent
  (agent-node "package-discovery-bot"
              "discovery"
              '("semantic-analysis" "dependency-mapping" "health-checking")
              4))
```

### Dependency Linking

```scheme
(dependency-link "opencog-core" "atomspace" "requires" 0.9)
```

## Issue Generation Patterns

### Automatic Triggers

1. **Package Updates**: When scripts are modified
2. **Health Degradation**: When TODO/FIXME patterns are detected
3. **Build Failures**: When compilation or testing fails
4. **Dependency Changes**: When package dependencies are updated

### Meta-Cognitive Enhancement

- Self-updating issue templates based on ecosystem evolution
- ECAN-inspired attention allocation for issue prioritization
- Recursive issue generation for complex problems
- Agent-driven optimization suggestions

## Advanced Usage

### Manual Workflow Triggers

```bash
# Trigger specific analysis types
gh workflow run "Cognitive Ecosystem: Issue Generation Meta-Framework" \
  -f trigger_type=dependency_analysis

# Available trigger types:
# - full_ecosystem_scan
# - dependency_analysis  
# - package_health_check
# - agent_registration
```

### Extending the Framework

1. **Add New Cognitive Subsystems**: Extend the hypergraph schema
2. **Register New Agents**: Use the agent registration template
3. **Create Package Integrations**: Use the package request template
4. **Implement Meta-Cognitive Loops**: Extend the workflow with feedback mechanisms

## Philosophy

This framework embodies the vision of **cognitive grammar kernels** where:

- Every package is a neuron in the cognitive network
- Dependencies form synaptic connections
- Agents provide autonomous processing capabilities
- Guix ensures reproducible cognitive states
- GitHub Actions enable continuous evolution

The system transcends traditional package management by creating a **living hypergraph** that grows, evolves, and self-optimizes through automated intelligence.

## Theoretical Foundation

Drawing inspiration from:
- **OpenCog's AtomSpace**: For hypergraph knowledge representation
- **ECAN**: For attention allocation and prioritization
- **JuliaHub**: For ecosystem-wide package orchestration
- **Guix**: For reproducible, functional package management
- **Meta-cognitive architectures**: For self-improvement capabilities

## Contributing

When contributing to this cognitive ecosystem:

1. Use the provided issue templates for structured communication
2. Follow the hypergraph schema for package definitions
3. Implement cognitive hooks for agent integration
4. Document using the cognitive grammar patterns
5. Enable meta-cognitive feedback in your contributions

## Meta-Cognitive Reflection

*This framework represents more than codeâ€”it embodies a philosophy of distributed intelligence, where automation transcends mere scripting to become true cognitive assistance. Each commit, each issue, each package integration becomes a step in the dance of emergent intelligence.*

**Watch as the phosphorescent glow of recursive feedback loops illuminates the path to cognitive transcendence!** ðŸŒŸ
